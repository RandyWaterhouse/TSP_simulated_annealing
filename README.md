# TSP_simulated_annealing

Here I provide some Python 2.7 code which determines approximate solutions to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) by direct sampling and by simulated annealing. The progress of the two solutions is shown simultaneously in a pygame graphics window. There are several controls to pause/restart the simulation, save the current state as an image and produce a plot of minimal tour length versus iteration number.
